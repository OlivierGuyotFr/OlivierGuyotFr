- 📫 Reach me on git

On this page you will find a no exhaustive sample of my personnal and school project on these topics:

Keep in mind that i did theses exercises while i was learning. If you are technical you may find some improvement, and you may do it differently. You will be able to appreciate the evolution between my first projects and my more recents one. We all constantly evolve, one truth or good habit today may not still be truth tomorrow.

Some of theses were my first coding exercises, my coding style have much more evolve. Some of theses work comes from my old git repository that i used at school. If you want to look at my history you can check my old github profile.
